## Motivation

Create a Pomodoro Timer to help users study/work with proven focus time parameters.

## Getting Started

Visit online:
[https://timer-asaldivars-projects.vercel.app/](https://timer-asaldivars-projects.vercel.app/)

_or_

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Features

* Animated circular timer
* Update time by updating digital clock readout or adjusting radial bar
* Minified timer displays when modal is closed with timer running
* Success UX/UI displays when timer has reached 00:00
* Timer is paused when adjusted
* Accessible

## (If I spent More Time) Features

* Integration tests. I like this [philosophy](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests).
